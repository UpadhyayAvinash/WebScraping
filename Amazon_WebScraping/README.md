# Amazon Web Scraping Project

## Overview
This is a beginner-level web scraping project where we scrape data from the Amazon website, specifically targeting Xiaomi's Mobile landing page. We use Python, the `requests` library, and `Beautiful Soup` for web scraping, and the `csv` module to write the cleaned data into a CSV file.

- Python (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
